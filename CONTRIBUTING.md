### Testing your change
Make sure your `kubectl` context is set to your target cluster.
This will run the code locally:
#### Controller
Debug the code in an editor ie. VSCode, Cursor
```bash
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [

      {
        "name": "Launch Package",
        "type": "go",
        "request": "launch",
        "mode": "debug",
        "program": "${workspaceRoot}/cmd/main.go",
        "args": [],
        "showLog": true
